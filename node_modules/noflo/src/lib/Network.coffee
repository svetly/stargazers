# # The NoFlo network coordinator
#
# NoFlo networks consist of processes connected to each other
# via sockets attached from outports to inports.
#
# The role of the network coordinator is to take a graph and
# instantiate all the necessary processes from the designated
# components, attach sockets between them, and handle the sending
# of Initial Information Packets.

  # ## Loading components
  #
  # Components can be passed to the NoFlo network in two ways:
  #
  # * As direct, instantiated JavaScript objects
  # * As filenames

  # ## Add a process to the network
  #
  # Processes can be added to a network at either start-up time
  # or later. The processes are added with a node definition object
  # that includes the following properties:
  #
  # * `id`: Identifier of the process in the network. Typically a string
  # * `component`: Filename or path of a NoFlo component, or a component instance object

    # Processes are treated as singletons by their identifier. If
